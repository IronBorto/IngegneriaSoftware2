In the weekend Marco went to the mountains for the first time and he didn’t know the local fauna, during his hiking he found an animal that he had never seen and he take a picture of it. Back to home he want to know what animal it was, so Marco opens his favourite browser, goes to www.wherehaveiseenthisbefore.com and he submits the photo in the “Animals” section. The web site then responds that the animal in the picture is a roe deer.
